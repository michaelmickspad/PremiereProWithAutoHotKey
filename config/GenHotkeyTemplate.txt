/*
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * This script will hold all the user's hotkeys
 * It is not meant to be written manually, but rather written by the "AHKScriptWriter.py"
 * python script, which will parse the hotkeys stored in the "userMadeHotkeys.json"
 * file and convert them into code that can be understood by AutoHotKey
 *
